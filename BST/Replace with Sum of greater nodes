Given a binary search tree, replace each nodes' data with the sum of all nodes' which are greater or equal than it.
You need to include the current node's data also.
That is, if in given BST there is a node with data 5, you need to replace it with sum of its data (i.e. 5) 
and all nodes whose data is greater than or equal to 5.

int replace(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root,int sum)
{
    if(root==NULL)
        return sum;
    
     sum=replace(root->right,sum);
      sum=sum +root->data;
      root->data=sum;
      sum =replace(root->left,sum);
    
   return  sum;
    
}
void replaceWithLargerNodesSum(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root) {
    if(root==NULL)return; 
    int ans =replace(root,0);
    
    return ;
  }
