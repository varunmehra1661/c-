Gary has two string S and V. Now Gary wants to know the length shortest subsequence in S such that it is not a subsequence in V.


Note: input data will be such so there will always be a solution.
Input Format :
Line 1 : String S of length N (1 <= N <= 1000)
Line 2 : String V of length M (1 <= M <= 1000)
Output Format :
Length of shortest subsequence in S such that it is not a subsequence in V
